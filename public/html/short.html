                <p>Newly built condo only 5 miles south of downtown Moab. Close to Arches and Canyonlands National Parks, Dead Horse State Park, the Sand Flats Recreational Area area, as well as numerous other amazing outdoor areas.</p>
                <p>There are 3 bedrooms; one with a king bed, and 2 with queen beds. There is also a queen sized pull out sofa, as well as 2 cots, and a pack 'n play. There are two bathrooms, a laundry room with washer and dryer, and a fully furnished kitchen. The patio has views of the Moab Rim and has a grill and patio furniture. In the living room there is also an electric fireplace that adds ambiance for those cooler nights in Moab.</p>
                <p>Guests have use of the whole house. The owner lives off site, but in town.</p>
                <p>I live in town and will have my number available if guests need anything. Occasionally, I will be out of town and unreachable, in which case I will have an alternate emergency number available to guests.</p>
                <p>A car is needed to see the sights in and around Moab.</p>
                <p>This unit is on the second story and there is no elevator. Being on the 2nd floor means that the views from the balcony are better!</p>
                <p>There are 2 smart TVs in the house (living room and master bedroom). A netflix account is provided.</p>
                <p>A Pack 'n Play is provided in the event that you are bringing an infant.</p>
                <p>A one time $75 cleaning fee is included on every reservation.</p>
                <p>The 10.5% room tax that all nightly rentals are required to collect is included in the price.</p>
